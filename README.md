# Overview

Troubleshoot specs for using when running with `support-bundle`.

# Folder Structure
`analyzers.yaml`: Analyzers could be run on any support bundle as long as you have the bundle tarball.

`collectors.yaml`: Collectors depending on the level of access they need can be run either from CLI or need to be injected via a secret so they are parameterized and have proper access to run it.

`support-bundle.yaml`: This has the final yaml that gets run with the `support-bundle` command. This file get auto-generated by a github action, anything you put in this file manually will be overwritten, so please do not add anything to this file.

# GitHub Action

The action runs a workflow that concats the various analyzer and collector yaml files into a single troubleshoot spec file using `concat.py`.
